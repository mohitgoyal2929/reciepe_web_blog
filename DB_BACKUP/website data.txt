Recipe Name: Creamy Broccoli Pizza
prep time: 45 min
cooking time: 50 min
makes: 4 medium pizza

Ingredients: 

Broccoli Cream
4 cups (280 g) broccoli florets
1 container (300 g) ricotta cheese
1/2 cup (35 g) Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
1/2 cup (125 ml) 35 % cream
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 green onion, cut into pieces

Toppings:
4 cups (280 g) broccoli florets
3/4 lb (340 g) asparagus
1 recipe pizza dough for 8 (see recipe)
1 cup (100 g) mozzarella cheese, grated
12 slices mild capicollo, torn in half
2 burratas, about 1/2 lb (225 g) each, drained and cut in half right before serving
2 cups (50 g) baby kale or arugula

Broccoli Cream
1. In a pot of salted boiling water, cook the broccoli until tender, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the broccoli (keep the pot of water). In a food processor, purée with the remaining ingredients until smooth. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the food processor as needed. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Toppings
2. Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).
3. In the same pot of salted boiling water, cook the broccoli until tender, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the broccoli and run under cold water. Cook the asparagus in the same water until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain and run under cold water.
4. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out one piece of dough into an 11-inch (28 cm) disc. Place on a square of parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining dough.
Cover each pizza with about 3/4 cup (180 ml) of the broccoli cream. Sprinkle with mozzarella. Divide the cooked vegetables and capicollo among the pizzas.
5. Place 1 pizza at a time (with the parchment paper) on the pizza stone. Cook for 10 minutes or until the dough is cooked through and nicely golden. Immediately garnish with the burratas and kale.
